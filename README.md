## Calories-Tracker App  ðŸŒ±
To keep track of the food calories using React.

## Project Description ðŸŒ¿
A light green color scheme for my Calories Tracker App because green is often associated with health and vitality, aligning with the app's focus on tracking nutrition and wellness.
<br>
Within the app, users can input their meals and their respective calorie counts. Upon clicking the "Add Meal" button, these entries are displayed below, allowing users to easily track their consumption. Each meal entry is accompanied by a "Delete Meal" button, enabling users to remove individual meal as needed. A "Delete All" button is available to clear the entire list of meals, providing convenience and flexibility in managing their dietary information.
